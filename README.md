## JS frameworks Course assignment


This a course assignment for learning the basics of React.
This assignment dident have a specific target audience so after looking at the api i chose to call the site Trend Setter,
because the API had diffrent products. I could have made something Temu or Alibaba like, but since the product list was short i thought that Trend Setter sounded more exclusive
